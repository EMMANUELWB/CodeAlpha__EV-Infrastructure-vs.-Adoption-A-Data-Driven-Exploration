# EV Infrastructure vs. Adoption: A Data-Driven Exploration
Exploring how the accessibility of EV charging stations influences the adoption of electric vehicles.  
Data from the **Electric Vehicle Population dataset**, analyzed using **Excel, SQL, R, and Tableau**.

---

## Project Overview

This project is part of the **CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship**.  
It focuses on uncovering insights from the **Electric Vehicle (EV) Population dataset** to understand adoption patterns, growth trends, and key performance indicators across the United States.  

The analysis follows a structured, data-driven workflow, from data profiling and cleaning to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and SQL-driven insights.

---

## Objective 
To analyze key patterns and trends in electric vehicle (EV) adoption using data-driven insights from the EV Population dataset.
The study focuses on how EV adoption evolved over time, which manufacturers and regions lead the market, and how electric range and price vary across models and years.

---

## Data Sources
**Electric Vehicle Population Data** — from U.S. government open data repositories.  

---

## Business Questions Explored
The analysis was designed to answer the following data-driven business questions using R, SQL, and Excel:

1. EV Adoption Trends: How has the total number of registered EVs changed over the years, and is adoption accelerating?
2. Range Evolution: What is the relationship between EV model year and the average electric range of vehicles?
3. Price vs. Range Relationship: How do average EV prices correlate with their electric range across different models and years?
4. Manufacturer Dominance: Which manufacturers consistently lead in EV sales across years and regions?  
5. Regional Adoption Patterns: Which counties or regions contribute the most to overall EV adoption, and how do they compare to national trends?

## Data Cleaning and Profiling Summary

### Data Profiling Overview
Before cleaning, both datasets underwent a **comprehensive profiling process** using R.  
This step helped identify data types, missing values, outliers, and distribution patterns to guide subsequent transformations.  

**Profiling Steps Included:**
- Detection of invalid or inconsistent records (e.g., missing coordinates or blank city names).  
- Summary statistics for numeric variables (`ElectricRange`, `BaseMSRP`, etc.).  
- Frequency analysis of categorical fields like `Make`, `ModelYear`, and `FuelTypeCode`.  
- Validation of relationships between geographic and vehicle data.  

Profiling ensured the datasets met all seven **data quality dimensions** — *accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, validity, uniqueness, and integrity* — before cleaning began.

## Data Quality Dimensions Ensured

Both datasets were assessed and cleaned according to seven key data quality dimensions to ensure analytical reliability and transparency:

| Dimension        | Description                                                                  | Example in This Project                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Accuracy**     | Verified data values against official sources and corrected inconsistencies. | Checked vehicle manufacturers and model names for valid categories.          |
| **Completeness** | Addressed missing fields and ensured key identifiers existed.                | Filled or flagged null entries for `City`, `State`, and `FuelTypeCode`.      |
| **Consistency**  | Standardized naming conventions and data formats.                            | Used consistent `State` abbreviations and unified units for `ElectricRange`. |
| **Timeliness**   | Used the most recent and relevant dataset versions.                          | Incorporated EV population data from 2024.                          |
| **Validity**     | Ensured each value met defined data type and domain rules.                   | Confirmed latitude/longitude values were within valid coordinate ranges.     |
| **Uniqueness**   | Removed duplicates across both datasets.                                     | Ensured unique `VIN` (vehicles) and `StationID` (charging stations).         |
| **Integrity**    | Maintained logical and relational consistency.                               | Preserved links between `Make`, `ModelYear`, and associated records.         |

- ## Note on Electric Vehicle Range Data Correction during `EDA`

During the analysis of the `ev_data2` dataset, I observed that many EVs for model years 2021 to 2024 had unrealistic `Electric_Range` values, ranging from 0 to 223 miles. Modern EVs generally have ranges well above 150 miles, so these entries were clearly underreported or missing.

To enable meaningful analysis, the `Electric_Range` for these years was estimated based on typical EV ranges for the respective model years:

| Model Year | Estimated Range (miles) |
|------------|-------------------------|
| 2021       | 250                     |
| 2022       | 280                     |
| 2023       | 300                     |
| 2024       | 320                     |

> **Disclaimer:** These values are estimates and have been applied only to entries with abnormally low ranges (<50 miles). All other data remain unchanged.  

This correction allows for accurate calculation of averages, trends, and visualizations without distorting historical data.

## Output
### Hypothesis Analysis Figures

The following figures illustrate key insights from the EV analyses conducted using R and SQL:

1. ### EV Adoption Trend with Regression

**Regression Equation:**  
`Total EVs = -4,434,325.17 + 2,203.34 × Year`  

**R-value:** 0.89  
**P-value:** < 0.001  

**Interpretation:**  
This model predicts a steady increase of ~2,203 EVs per year.
Forecast for 2025–2027 suggests adoption will continue to grow, reaching roughly 32,000 EVs by 2027.
Since the R-value is 0.89, this model explains a large portion of the trend, so the forecast is reasonably reliable for short-term projections.

2. ### EV Range Trend Over Years

**Regression Equation:**  
y=-14828.13+7.4423x 

R-value: 0.72 
P-value: 0.00015 

**Interpretation:** 
The average EV range is increasing ~7.44 km per year.
The R-value of 0.72 indicates a strong positive correlation.
P-value (0.00015) confirms the increase is statistically significant.

Forecast suggests that by 2027, the average EV range could reach ~253 km, continuing the upward trend.

3. ### EV Price vs Range Analysis

**Regression Equation:**  
`y = 0.0021x+13.3`  

**R-value:** 0.22  
**P-value:** 0.27  

**Interpretation:** 
Here, we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

This means there’s no statistically significant linear relationship between EV range and price.
